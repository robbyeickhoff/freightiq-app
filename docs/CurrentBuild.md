# FreightIQ Current Build

## Purpose

This document captures the current active FreightIQ build effort.

It is intentionally short. It is not a backlog, roadmap, or historical record. Its purpose is to
answer one question:

> What should we be working on right now?

---

## Current Objective

Create the separately approved iOS and Android production candidate builds from the accepted
`clean-main` state, submit them only to TestFlight and Google Play Internal Testing, and complete
the remaining installed-build acceptance gates before any broader distribution. The Product Owner
approved this candidate-release phase on 2026-08-03 after the Search Relevance and Preview Card
hydration correction passed focused physical-iPhone and Pixel acceptance.

This is a validation release, not a new product-development objective or a public rollout. Preserve
the accepted application and production-database state while validating the store-delivered builds.

## Completed Build Status

The approved Pre-Build Security Remediation was implemented and applied to production on
2026-08-02. Stop updates now require ownership or trusted-editor status; the Product Owner's
original account is the single initial trusted editor. Anonymous access to business contact and
check-in fields is closed, Early Access submissions are limited to applicant-controlled fields,
obsolete token-bearing Auth URL handling is removed, and the legacy entrance-photo bucket is
private with no app-user object policies. All seven archived objects and five stop references were
preserved. Database role tests, permission checks, mobile lint, website lint, and the website
production build passed. Focused physical-iPhone acceptance also passed. The website hardening was
committed and pushed in `be5836a`; the outer remediation was committed and pushed in `ae21a5b`.

The 2026-08-03 focused search correction is implemented locally and verified in production.
The first approved production migration exposed an ambiguous `id` reference during its first live
verification call and was immediately rolled back through a forward-only restoration migration.
The previous search function, security settings, execution grants, and nearby search behavior were
verified after restoration. The corrected forward migration qualifies both candidate ID sources and
is now live. Grand Junction searches returned Isun Skincare and Ridgway Animal Hospital; the
Ridgway `test` search returned all matching Grand Junction test stops; and nearby `ridgway` ordering
preserved Ridgway State Park. The function remains stable, security invoker, fixed to an empty
search path, and executable by the intended roles. Timed verification completed in roughly 47–115
milliseconds with cached reads and no writes. Advisors reported only the already-tracked security
and RLS performance notices. The app-side correction routes reconciled existing stops through the
direct FreightIQ selection path, loads report-backed core intel explicitly by stop ID, merges report
summaries rather than replacing the complete map cache, and shows an unresolved state rather than
false missing intel. Physical-iPhone acceptance passed direct FreightIQ selection, Mapbox-to-
FreightIQ reconciliation, distant name discovery, nearby ordering, new-place separation, and
Preview Card hydration. The distant Florida `test` result was confirmed as a legitimate FreightIQ
stop created by the Product Owner, not a search defect. Docker remains unavailable for a local
Supabase reset. The same focused acceptance matrix subsequently passed on the physical Pixel.

Authentication V2 is implemented, accepted locally, committed in `1a35d08`, and pushed to
`clean-main` on 2026-08-02. The completed work includes the central session gate, password-first
sign-in, confirmed-email account creation, in-app signup and recovery codes, temporary login-code
fallback, V2 onboarding handoff, approved Supabase authentication configuration, branded email
templates, and the password-changed notification. The working Resend SMTP configuration was
preserved.

The Product Owner's existing account completed password migration with the same Driver Profile,
201 reports, 7 votes, and 205 owned stops preserved. Session persistence, logout, rejection of the
former password, returning sign-in with the new password, used-code rejection, and full app close
and reopen passed on physical iPhone. A controlled new account completed confirmation, Driver
Profile and Tractor Type setup, welcome handoff, logout, and returning sign-in before its verified
test-only Auth and profile data were deleted. The Product Owner then restored the original account
successfully. Temporary LAN-specific Expo Go redirects were removed; only `mfi://auth` and
`mfi://update-password` remain in the production allow list.

Standalone iPhone, Pixel, broader accessibility, edge-case, and new-tester validation remain release
gates and do not keep the accepted implementation open as the active build.

The following focused workstreams were accepted on iPhone and Pixel, committed separately, and
pushed to `clean-main` on 2026-08-01:

- `0f2002d` — Location-aware Search Relevance
- `013225b` — Stop Preview Card return reliability
- `74fc484` — Driver Reports Preview Card presentation
- `e3a16fa` — Navigation App Choice
- `b9432fd` — Structured Contact / Check-In

The local branch and `origin/clean-main` matched at the start of this objective. Authentication V2
has now passed focused physical-iPhone acceptance, and the Product Owner approved its commit and
push on 2026-08-02. Installed-build validation remains separately gated.

Search Relevance and Structured Contact / Check-In include separately approved production database
migrations that were applied and verified. No EAS build, TestFlight or Google Play distribution,
deployment, or release was performed for this completed tranche.

## Remaining Release Gates

- Complete the remaining Authentication V2 edge-case, accessibility, Pixel, and standalone-iPhone
  validation in the appropriate installed build.
- Verify Search Relevance and accumulated app changes in an appropriate standalone candidate build.
- Verify native installed-app detection for Navigation App Choice outside Expo Go.
- Recheck standalone iPhone stability; the observed Expo Go reload crash remains development-
  container evidence rather than a confirmed FreightIQ defect.
- Run the applicable Release Process only after separate Product Owner approval.

---

## Open Findings Outside the Completed Scope

- Graceful recovery from an invalid persisted Supabase refresh token is implemented locally; a
  targeted invalid-token regression remains part of installed-build validation.
- The focused place-search provider review remains open before any Mapbox replacement decision.
- Repository-wide TypeScript verification still reports the two pre-existing website demo import
  failures involving `HowItWorksWorkflow` and `RealExampleDiagram`.
- The pre-existing `public.rls_auto_enable()` execution warning, unavailable-on-Free leaked-password
  protection, older RLS initialization-plan performance warnings, and API-key review remain
  separate security workstreams.

---

## Not Changing Without Separate Approval

- Supabase schema, policies, functions, or production data
- Authentication provider, password, rate-limit, email, or security settings
- Email-provider, SMTP, DNS, mobile redirect, or credential configuration
- EAS, TestFlight, Google Play, deployment, or release state

---

## Next Safe Step

Create traceable production candidates through the approved Release Process, submit them only to
TestFlight and Google Play Internal Testing, and personally validate the remaining release gates on
the installed iPhone and Pixel builds before expanding distribution.
